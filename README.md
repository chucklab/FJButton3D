# FJButton3D
3D button component made in Swift

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedejordan/FJButton3D/master/demo.gif)

> This project has started as a component in a own project and I want to open the code in case anyone need the same functionality.

### Main features
+ Customize front and back colors
+ Setup status and if it is a toggle

### Installation
Clone the repository and copy the file `FJButton3D.swift` to your project.

### Usage
Add a `UIView` component to your view controller xib or storyboard and change the class name (in the second tab of Utilites panel) to `FJButton3D`. 

You may want to implement `FJButton3DDelegate` (in the button `delegate` property) to know when the user tap the button

In storyboard, there are some `@IBInspectable` properties to allow easily custom the component.
